# An example of Deep Learning using transfer learning in Keras.
 
1. What is transfer learning ?
2. Why we use a transfer learnign model ?
3. How we can build a transfer learning model ?


### What is transfer learning ?
Transfer learning is another approach that we can use to classify images. Transfer learning models are trained on one problem and applying to another one. Transfer learning, also, can be very useful because Deep convolutional neural network models may take days or even weeks to train on very large datasets. Therefore, I use a pre trained model with weights. In our case I use VGG16. This model have been trained how to detect generic features from pictures more than 1 million of images and trained to 1000 classes.
